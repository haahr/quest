# The Quest Programming Language

A modern implementation of **Quest**, Luca Cardelli's language based on higher-order subtyping
(System $F_{<:}^\omega$), impredicative bounded quantification, and type operators within a three-level universe:
- **Level 2 (Kinds):** `TYPE`, `POWER(T)`, and `ALL(X::K1) K2`.
- **Level 1 (Types and Type Operators):** Records, tuples, variants, options, functions, recursive types, and
  compile-time type operators (`Fun(X::K) T`).
- **Level 0 (Values):** First-class functions, mutable cells (`var`), exceptions, and modules.

The ultimate objective of this project is a **fully self-hosted compiler written in Quest itself**, targeting native
**AArch64 (ARM64)** machine code with an interactive in-process **JIT compiler**.

## Why?

I read Luca Cardelli's paper [*Typeful Programming*](http://lucacardelli.name/Papers/TypefulProg.pdf) when I was an undergraduate and I was taken both by its philosophical arguments – *"There exists an identifiable programming style based on the widespread use of typeinformation handled through mechanical typechecking techniques"* – and the power and elegance of its design. But, as far as I know, the original implementation was never made public and I never had a chance to use it.

Flash forward nearly four decades, I'm late to the party on agentic programming and vibe coding, but have recently gotten a taste of how much is possible. I wanted a hobby project to stretch my skills in directing a model to build something interesting, so I decided to build a version of Quest that I could actually play with. At the risk of having this project dismissed as AI slop, I will straightforwardly say that every line of code (and, other than this section, of documentation) in this project was written by Gemini (3.7 and 3.8 Flash, so far) or Claude (Opus 5.5) in [Google Antigravity](https://antigravity.google/) or [Claude Cowork](https://claude.com/product/cowork).

I've been trying to keep the design clean and the code readable; I've found Dave Rensin's paper and methodology [*Elephants, Goldfish and the New Golden Age of Software Engineering (or, Design is the New Code)*](https://drensin.medium.com/elephants-goldfish-and-the-new-golden-age-of-software-engineering-c33641a48874) to be very helpful in that regard. But, if human-guided, AI-written code bothers you, please stay away.

Otherwise, if you're interested in a retro programming language and an interesting waypoint in the evolution types, take it out for a spin. *— Paul Haahr*

## Roadmap Summary

The compiler is built using a staged bootstrap methodology across seven distinct phases:

| Stage | Language | Subsystem | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Step 1** | Python | Front-End: Lexer, PEG Parser, and Untyped AST | **Complete** |
| **Step 2** | Python | Typechecker: $F_{<:}^\omega$ Subtyping, Equi-Recursion, Elaboration | **Complete** |
| **Step 3** | Python | Tree-Walking Interpreter & Interactive REPL | **Complete** |
| **Step 4** | Python | Bootstrap C Transpiler (emits C99 + Boehm GC) | **Complete** (Phases 4.1–4.16) |
| **Step 5** | Quest | Self-Hosted Front-End & C Compiler (written in Quest) | Queued |
| **Step 6** | Quest | Self-Hosted Native AArch64 Compiler (Nanopass Pipeline) | Queued |
| **Step 7** | Quest | Native AArch64 JIT & Dynamic Incremental Runtime | Queued |

For full architectural details on each stage, see [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md).

## Quickstart

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+ (used for the bootstrap compiler and test runner).
- Host C compiler (`clang` or `gcc`) for compiling generated C99 code.
- Optional: [Boehm GC](https://github.com/ivmai/bdw-gc) (`bdw-gc` via Homebrew: `brew install bdw-gc`).
  The compiler automatically falls back to standard libc allocations when `--nogc` is specified.

### Running and Compiling Quest Code
Use the unified compiler driver script `./quest`:

```bash
# Evaluate an inline Quest expression via the interpreter
./quest -e "let x: Int = 40 + 2; x"

# Execute a Quest file via the tree-walking interpreter
./quest program.quest

# Compile Quest source to a native binary (using host clang/gcc)
./quest compile program.quest

# Compile to an explicit output binary
./quest compile program.quest -o my_app

# Emit generated C99 source code without invoking the host compiler
./quest compile program.quest --emit-c

# Compile without Boehm GC (using standard libc malloc/calloc)
./quest compile program.quest --nogc -o my_app

# Compile and stop after a specific phase to inspect canonical output:
./quest --stop-after tokenize program.quest          # Dumps token stream
./quest --stop-after parse program.quest             # Dumps untyped S-expression AST
./quest --stop-after typecheck program.quest         # Dumps typed S-expression AST
./quest compile --stop-after codegen_c program.quest # Dumps emitted C99 source

# Dump intermediate representations while continuing:
./quest --dump-after parse --stop-after typecheck program.quest

# Add include search paths for imported interfaces/modules:
./quest -I ./lib -I ./interfaces main.quest
```

### Running Tests
The project includes comprehensive unit tests, golden-file integration tests, and inline diagnostic error tests:

```bash
# Run all golden integration tests and diagnostic error tests
python3 run_tests.py

# Run only golden tests or only diagnostic error tests
python3 run_tests.py --suite golden
python3 run_tests.py --suite errors

# Run all unit tests
PYTHONPATH=bootstrap/python python3 -m unittest discover -s tests/python
```

## Known Differences from Typeful Programming

While this implementation strives for high fidelity to Luca Cardelli's
[*Typeful Programming*](http://lucacardelli.name/Papers/TypefulProg.pdf), several practical distinctions exist:

1. **Systems of Interfaces:**
   Cardelli discusses "systems of interfaces" in the "Huge Programs" section (§7.3) as a conceptual mechanism to group
   and configure interdependent interfaces and modules. However, this feature was not clearly defined or given formal
   syntax in the paper, and requires further thought before implementation. As Cardelli noted in Section 1:
   > *"The example language is still speculative in some parts; the boundary between solid and tentative features can
   > be detected by looking at the formal syntax in the Appendix. Features that have been given syntax there have also
   > been implemented and are relatively well thought out. Other features described in the paper should be regarded
   > with more suspicion"*

2. **Dynamic Serialization (`dynamic.extern` / `dynamic.intern`):**
   Cardelli envisioned dynamic values serializing arbitrary data and code representations. In this implementation,
   `dynamic.extern` and `dynamic.intern` serialize and deserialize typed values (primitives, records, tuples, variants,
   options, arrays, dynamic packages, and type descriptors) with cyclic reference preservation. Serialization of
   first-class functions and closures is not supported due to portability, code versioning, and execution
   environment constraints.

3. **Hierarchical Module Namespaces & Signature Aliasing:**
   Cardelli's module system placed all interfaces and modules in a single flat namespace, with "systems of modules"
   (§7.3) remaining an underspecified concept. This implementation of Quest introduces hierarchical module namespaces
   with forward slashes (`/`) mapping directly to filesystem directory trees (e.g. `import util/random : util/Random;`),
   along with two-tier local signature aliasing (`import rnd : Rnd = util/random : util/Random;` and
   `import :Rnd = :util/Random;`).

For full details on language extensions (including the `System` OS interface and native `external` syntax) as well as
runtime additions, see [docs/extensions.md](docs/extensions.md).
