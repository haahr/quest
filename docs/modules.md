# Quest Module System and File Imports

This document describes the Quest module system based on Luca Cardelli's *Typeful Programming* (§7.1), including interfaces, module implementations, information hiding, file-based loading conventions, search path resolution, and evaluation semantics.

---

## 1. Overview and Theoretical Foundations

Quest implements a first-order module system as described by Luca Cardelli in *Typeful Programming* (1991, §7.1):

- **Interfaces (`interface ... export ... end`):** Specifications describing types, kinds, and value signatures. They define the public contract that implementation modules must satisfy.
- **Modules (`module m: I ... export ... end`):** Implementations that provide concrete definitions matching an interface. Modules can have private local state and bindings hidden behind the interface.
- **Information Hiding & Abstract Types:**
  - An abstract type declared in an interface (`T::TYPE`) is opaque to consumers of any module implementing that interface.
  - In the module's export scope, `T` becomes an opaque type variable unique to that module instance (`m.T`), preventing clients from depending on its internal representation.
  - A manifest type declared in an interface (`Def T = Int` or `Let T = Int`) is transparent, and its definition is known to all clients.
- **Singleton Module Semantics:** Modules are instantiated at most once at link time. When multiple modules or phrases import the same module (e.g. in diamond dependencies), all importers share the identical runtime record and mutable state cells.

---

## 2. File Conventions & Search Rules

When the Quest compiler or interpreter encounters an import for an interface or module that is not already registered in the lexical environment or built-in registry (`BuiltinModuleRegistry`), it automatically loads it from disk.

### 2.1. File Extensions, Case Normalization, and Hierarchical Directories
- **Interfaces:** Saved with the extension `.int.quest`.
- **Modules:** Saved with the extension `.mod.quest`.
- **Hierarchical Paths:** Unquoted forward slashes (`/`) represent directory nesting. For example, `util/random`
  maps to the path `util/random.mod.quest` (or `util/random.int.quest`).
- **Case Normalization:** When searching for a file, the compiler normalizes the filename components to lowercase:
  - An interface `util/Counter` or `util/counter` maps to `util/counter.int.quest`.
  - A module `util/Stack` or `util/stack` maps to `util/stack.mod.quest`.
  This ensures deterministic, portable behavior across case-sensitive (Linux) and case-insensitive (macOS, Windows)
  filesystems.

### 2.2. Search Order Precedence & Sibling Relative Resolution
The file loader searches directories in the following strict order:
1. **Implicit Active Directory (Sibling Relative):** The directory containing the active `.quest` file or currently
   compiling module is searched first. For instance, if `util/calc.mod.quest` imports `math`, the loader searches for
   `util/math.mod.quest` before searching root include directories.
2. **Explicit Include Paths (`-I`):** Any directories specified on the command line via `-I` / `--include` (or
   configured in `CompilerOptions.include_paths`), searched in command-line order.

A file in the active directory shadows any file with the same name in the include paths.

---

## 3. Single Definition Rule and Strict Validation

To keep compilation units clean, modular, and predictable, interface and module files must adhere to strict
structural constraints:

1. **Single Top-Level Phrase:**
   A `.int.quest` file must contain **strictly one** top-level phrase: an `interface` declaration.
   A `.mod.quest` file must contain **strictly one** top-level phrase: a `module` definition.
   Top-level expressions, `let` bindings, or standalone `import` statements outside the construct are prohibited.
2. **Name Matching:**
   The identifier declared in the file header must match the filename basename (case-insensitively). For example,
   `util/counter.int.quest` must declare `interface Counter` (or `counter`), not `interface Bag`.
3. **Interface Conformance:**
   In a module file `m.mod.quest`, the interface specified in the module header (`module m: I` or `module m: Path/I`)
   must match the expected interface requested by the importer or define a canonical relative interface path.
4. **Cycle Detection:**
   The loader tracks the active import chain. Circular imports among interfaces (e.g., `A` imports `B`
   which imports `A`) or modules are detected and reported as compile-time errors displaying the cycle path.

---

## 4. Syntax and Usage

### 4.1. Interface Declarations (`.int.quest`)
An interface declaration exports abstract types, manifest types, kinds, and value signatures:

```quest
(* util/counter.int.quest *)
interface Counter
export
    T::TYPE
    new(init: Int): T
    inc(c: T): T
    get(c: T): Int
end;
```

Interfaces can also import other interfaces using a leading `import` clause with hierarchical paths:
```quest
interface ExtendedCounter
import :util/Counter
export
    reset(c: Counter.T): Counter.T
end;
```

### 4.2. Module Definitions (`.mod.quest`)
A module provides concrete implementations for the members specified in its interface:

```quest
(* util/counter.mod.quest *)
module counter : Counter
export
    Let T = Int;
    let new(init: Int): T = init;
    let inc(c: T): T = c + 1;
    let get(c: T): Int = c;
end;
```

Modules can declare internal imports before their export block:
```quest
(* app.mod.quest *)
module app : App
import util/counter: util/Counter
export
    let run(): Int = counter.get(counter.inc(counter.new(10)));
end;
```

### 4.3. Top-Level Imports & Hierarchical Aliasing (`main.quest`)
Client programs import interfaces and modules using the two-tier `import` syntax:

- **Flat Imports (Backward-Compatible):**
  ```quest
  import counter: Counter;
  import :Counter;
  ```

- **Hierarchical Path Imports:**
  ```quest
  import util/counter: util/Counter;
  import :util/Counter;
  ```
  When imported without aliases, the bound local names default to the final component (e.g. `counter` and `Counter`).

- **Local Signature Aliasing:**
  To prevent local identifier collisions or assign concise local names, this implementation of Quest supports
  signature-based aliasing for both modules and interfaces:
  - **Both Module and Interface Aliased:**
    ```quest
    import cnt : Cnt = util/counter : util/Counter;
    ```
    Binds module value `cnt` and interface types/kinds `Cnt` (e.g. `Cnt_T`).
  - **Module Aliased Only:**
    ```quest
    import cnt = util/counter : util/Counter;
    ```
    Binds module value `cnt` and interface types `Counter` (e.g. `Counter_T`).
  - **Interface Aliased with Module:**
    ```quest
    import :Cnt = util/counter : util/Counter;
    ```
    Binds default module value `counter` and aliased interface types `Cnt` (e.g. `Cnt_T`).
  - **Standalone Interface Aliased:**
    ```quest
    import :Cnt = :util/Counter;
    ```
    Binds aliased interface types `Cnt` into scope without instantiating any module.
  - **Multiple Modules for One Interface:**
    ```quest
    import c1 = util/counter1, c2 = util/counter2 : util/Counter;
    ```

In all contexts, `/` in expressions (e.g. `10 / 2`) remains the standard division operator without syntactic ambiguity.

---

## 5. Singleton Evaluation & Diamond Dependencies

Cardelli's module system defines modules as link-time singletons. At runtime:
- Each module is evaluated at most once when first imported.
- Subsequent imports of the same module retrieve the cached module record (`QRecord`).
- Mutable state (`let var`) encapsulated within a module is preserved across all importing sites.

### Example: Shared Mutable State Across Diamond Imports
```
        +---------------+
        |  store.mod    |  (let var count = 0)
        +---------------+
          /           \
         /             \
+---------------+   +---------------+
| clienta.mod   |   | clientb.mod   |  (both import store: Store)
+---------------+   +---------------+
         \             /
          \           /
        +---------------+
        |   main.quest  |  (imports clienta and clientb)
        +---------------+
```

When `clienta` invokes `store.inc()`, the mutation is immediately visible when `clientb` calls `store.get()`. Both clients interact with the exact same runtime instance.

---

## 6. Compiler CLI Integration

The Quest driver (`quest`) and compiler pipeline support include paths using the standard `-I` flag:

```bash
# Search current directory first, then ./lib and ./interfaces:
quest -I ./lib -I ./interfaces main.quest

# In interactive REPL mode:
quest -i -I ./lib

# Native C compilation mode:
quest compile -I ./lib main.quest -o main_app
```

---

## 7. Compilation Architecture & Implementation Roadmap

The Quest C compiler's module support is designed in two complementary stages:

### Stage 1: Whole-Program Compilation (Initial Implementation)
In Stage 1, the compiler starts from a root source file, processes all explicit and implicit `import` declarations
recursively, and builds a complete in-memory typed AST model of the program (`Environment.loaded_modules_ast`).
When all imports have been resolved, typechecked, and verified, the compiler emits a single self-contained C
translation unit (`.c` file) that compiles directly with standard C99:

1. **Acyclic Dependency Enforcement (Cardelli §7.1):**
   - As Cardelli explicitly specifies (*Typeful Programming* §7.1, p. 55): *"The import dependencies of both
     modules and interfaces must form a directed acyclic graph; that is, mutually recursive imports are not
     allowed to guarantee that the linking process is deterministic."*
   - Neither interfaces nor modules may form cycles. Topological sort order is guaranteed to be unambiguous
     and deterministic.
2. **Module Export Representation (First-Class `QRecordVal` Fat Pointers):**
   - Each module `m : I` compiles to a top-level C record variable `static QRecordVal qm_m;`. Module records use
     their own `qm_` prefix so that they cannot collide with a user identifier of the same name (`qv_m`).
   - The interface `I` specifies the record struct shape `QT_I` containing function pointers, closures, and values.
   - `qm_m` stores `.val` pointing to the allocated payload struct and `.dict` pointing to the static identity
     evidence dictionary `&offsetdict_I_I`.
3. **Abstract Type Erasure to `QVal`:**
   - In interface records, abstract types (`T::TYPE`) cannot have known concrete scalar representations across
     compilation boundaries. Field signatures in the interface record use uniform 64-bit words (`QVal` / `void *`),
     and concrete implementations wrap values into `QVal` (`_qval_wrap`) during module record initialization.
4. **Manifest Type Erasure:**
   - Interface records (`QT_<Interface>`) only store value components (`FieldSig`); manifest types (`Def T = ...`)
     and kinds are erased at runtime and do not generate struct fields.
5. **Topological Module Initialization (`_init`):**
   - Each module emits an initialization function `static void qv_mod_<name>_init(void)` protected by an idempotent
     boolean flag `static bool qv_mod_<name>_initialized;`.
   - The initializer recursively calls the initializers of all its dependencies in topological order, allocates
     the payload struct, executes the module's internal statements and `let var` bindings, and writes the exported
     members into the module record.
   - `main()` invokes the initializers of all top-level imported modules before executing the main script phrases.
     This guarantees singleton semantics across diamond dependency graphs.
6. **Identifier Mangling:**
   - Internal module variables, lifted lambdas, and closures are prefixed with their module name
     (`qv_<module>_<name>`), preventing name collisions in the single translation unit.
7. **Unified Native Module Mechanism (Approach B):**
   - All standard library modules (`writer`, `reader`, `conv`, `ascii`, `int`, `real`, `string`, `system`,
     `arrayOp`, `dynamic`) and user-defined hybrid modules are unified under the standard `TypedModule` pipeline.
   - Builtin functions and constants are annotated with `c_symbol`, `inline_template`, and `c_val`.
   - Direct calls on known modules inline native calls directly without closure overhead.
   - First-class module records populate closure trampolines (`qv_<mod>_<name>_trampoline`) and concrete evaluated
     constants, providing full Cardelli first-class module semantics.

---

## 8. Unified Native Module Mechanism & Hybrid Quest/C Modules

Rather than treating built-in modules as ad-hoc compiler-internal special cases, Quest unifies all modules
(pure Quest modules, standard library modules, and user-defined hybrid modules) through a single architectural pipeline:

### 8.1. Declarative Module Architecture
- Built-in modules are represented as standard `TypedModule` ASTs registered in `BuiltinModuleRegistry`.
- Member functions can be pure Quest functions, native functions (`TypedNativeBinding` with `c_symbol` or
  `inline_template`), or external C values (`TypedExternal` with `c_val`).

### 8.2. Dual-Path Code Generation
The C backend optimizes module member access while preserving full first-class module semantics:
1. **Direct Call Lowering:**
   When a function is called directly on a known module (e.g. `writer.putString(w s)` or `conv.int(n)`), the compiler
   emits the direct C function call (`quest_writer_put_string(...)`) or expands the inline template, entirely bypassing
   closure allocation and dictionary dispatch.
2. **First-Class Concrete Value Records:**
   When a module is referenced as a value (e.g. `let m = writer;` or passed as a parameter), the module's initializer
   `qv_mod_<name>_init()` allocates the record payload and populates all fields with **concrete values**:
   - Native and Quest functions are wrapped in allocated `QClosure` structures pointing to static trampolines.
   - Native constants and evaluated `let` values are stored directly in the record fields.
   - Once loaded, no field accesses require dynamic getter hooks; all fields are concrete values stored in the record.

### 8.3. Hybrid Quest/C Modules
Developers can write modules that seamlessly combine Quest code and C implementations:
```quest
(* fileio.int.quest *)
interface FileIO
export
    Handle::TYPE
    stdout: Handle
    writeHello(h: Handle): Ok
end;

(* fileio.mod.quest *)
module fileio : FileIO
import writer: Writer
export
    Let Handle = external "QWriter *";
    let stdout: Handle = external "quest_writer_output";
    let writeHello(h: Handle): Ok =
        writer.putString(h "Hello Native!\n");
end;
```
Inside `fileio`, `writeHello` is a pure Quest function that calls into the native `writer` module, while `Handle`
and `stdout` bind directly to underlying C runtime types and symbols.

### 8.4. Lazy Loading Semantics
Following Cardelli's specification, module loading is lazy:
- Modules initialize on first reference or at the start of the program unit.
- Initialization is guarded by `qv_mod_<name>_initialized` to guarantee single evaluation.
- Dependencies are resolved and initialized in topological order prior to evaluating local bindings.

---

## 9. Separate Compilation Architecture (Phase 4.16)

This implementation of Quest supports separate compilation of interfaces and modules, enabling modular builds and
object linking:

### 9.1. Interface Compilation (`.int.quest` -> `.int.h` + `.qi`)
Compiling an interface (`quest -c counter.int.quest`) generates two complementary artifacts:
1. **C Header (`x.int.h`):**
   - Named `x.int.h` rather than `x.h` so that an interface named like a C library header (`math`, `string`,
     `time`, ...) cannot shadow it: generated-code directories are on the C compiler's include path, and the
     runtime includes `<math.h>` and others ([build-process.md §3.2](build-process.md)).
   - Preprocessor guards (`#ifndef QUEST_INTF_X_H ... #endif`).
   - `#include "quest_runtime.h"`.
   - Recursive `#include "<dep>.int.h"` for any imported interfaces (`import : Dep`).
   - Abstract types (`T::TYPE`) erase to uniform 64-bit words (`typedef QVal quest_type_X_T;`).
   - Manifest types (`Def T = ...`) emit concrete C typedefs or struct definitions.
   - Function pointer typedefs (`typedef <Ret> (*quest_sig_X_<member>)(<Params>);`).
2. **Type Metadata (`x.qi`):**
   - A serialized dynamic value ([dynamic.md](dynamic.md) §2) of Quest's shadow record types (`InterfaceDesc`):
     ```quest
     Let InterfaceTypeDecl = Record
         isManifest: Bool
         kind: String
         manifestType: String
         name: String
     end;

     Let InterfaceValueDecl = Record
         isPoly: Bool
         name: String
         typeSig: String
     end;

     Let InterfaceDesc = Record
         imports: Array(String)
         name: String
         types: Array(InterfaceTypeDecl)
         values: Array(InterfaceValueDecl)
     end;
     ```
   - Serialized via `dynamic.extern` / `jsog_encode` and deserialized via `dynamic.intern` / `jsog_decode`.
   - Allows the compiler to typecheck client code or implementing modules without the original `.int.quest` source.

### 9.2. Module Compilation (`.mod.quest` -> `.mod.c` -> `.o`)
Compiling a module implementation (`quest -c counter.mod.quest`) generates both C source and relocatable object files:
1. **C Source File (`<name>.mod.c`):**
   - Includes `#include "quest_runtime.h"` and `#include "<interface>.int.h"`.
   - **Dual Linkage ABI:**
     - Direct C functions: Exported interface member functions are emitted with external C linkage
       (`qv_<mod>_<func>(...)`), allowing native C calls and optimal direct linking without closure indirection.
     - Trampolines: Small `static` functions (`qv_<mod>_<func>_trampoline`) wrapping direct functions for closure
       dispatch.
     - Module record: The global module singleton `QRecordVal qm_<mod>;` is declared with external C linkage and
       populated with closures pointing to trampolines during initialization.
   - **Idempotent Chained Initialization:** Emits an exported initialization routine `void qv_mod_<mod>_init(void)`
     with an internal `initialized` guard. Before executing module expressions, it automatically calls the
     initialization functions of any imported dependency modules (`qv_mod_<dep>_init()`), ensuring all transitive
     module state is ready before use.
2. **Relocatable Object File (`<name>.o`):**
   - Produced by invoking the host C compiler (`clang -c <name>.mod.c -o <name>.o -I runtime -I <include_paths>`).
   - Both `<name>.mod.c` and `<name>.o` are retained on disk for debugging, inspection, and native linking.

### 9.3. Client Compilation & Object Linking (`main.quest` + `*.o` -> Native Binary)
Compiling client code that depends on precompiled modules links `.o` files directly into the native executable:
1. **Invocation Syntax & Search Paths:**
   - Explicit object files: `quest main.quest counter.o -o my_app` (or `quest compile main.quest counter.o -o my_app`).
   - Auto-discovery: When `import counter : Counter` is processed, if `counter.o` exists in the current directory or
     any directory specified via `-I`, the compiler automatically registers `counter` as a precompiled module and
     queues `counter.o` for linking.
   - Source independence: The module implementation source (`counter.mod.quest`) does not need to exist on disk;
     typechecking and code generation rely solely on the interface (`counter.qi` or `counter.int.quest`) and the
     precompiled object file.
2. **Dual Linkage ABI & External Declarations:**
   - In the emitted client C code, precompiled modules emit external declarations for both linkage forms:
     - Direct C functions: `extern <Ret> qv_<mod>_<func>(<Params>);`
     - Global module record: `extern QRecordVal qm_<mod>;`
     - Initializer: `extern void qv_mod_<mod>_init(void);`
   - Direct calls (`counter.inc(c)`) lower to fast native C calls `qv_counter_inc(c)`.
   - Closure access (`let f = counter.inc; f(c)`) extracts closures from `qv_counter` and dispatches via trampolines.
3. **Signature Adaptation & Abstract Type ABI:**
   - Exported interface types define the canonical C ABI at module boundaries. Abstract types (`T::TYPE`) erase
     uniformly to `QVal`.
   - When a module implements an interface where concrete types differ from interface representations (e.g. `T`
     implemented as a record `QRecordVal` vs. interface `QVal`), the module compiler emits internal implementations
     (`_qv_<mod>_<func>_impl`) alongside exported boundary adapters (`qv_<mod>_<func>`) and trampolines that safely
     box and unbox arguments and return values using `quest_record_box` and value unwrappers.
4. **Binary Generation:**
   - The pipeline compiles the client C file and invokes the host C compiler (`clang`), passing all required
     runtime files (`quest_runtime.c`, `quest_serialization.c`), precompiled object files (`counter.o`), and GC
     libraries to produce the final executable binary.

### 9.4. Hierarchical Modules and C Symbol Mangling
When compiling hierarchical interfaces and modules:
1. **Directory Tree Preservation:**
   When an interface or module in a subdirectory is compiled (e.g. `quest -c util/calc.mod.quest`), the compiler
   creates matching output subdirectories in the target destination, writing `util/calc.mod.c`, `util/calc.o`,
   and `util/calc.int.h`.
2. **C Symbol Mangling:**
   Because C identifiers cannot contain forward slashes, directory delimiters in hierarchical module names are mangled
   to `__` (double underscore):
   - Module record: `qv_util__calc`
   - Initializer: `qv_mod_util__calc_init`
   - Initialized flag: `qv_mod_util__calc_initialized`
   - Direct functions: `qv_util__calc_multiply`
   - Trampolines: `qv_util__calc_multiply_trampoline`
   Single underscores (`_`) continue to cleanly separate module prefixes from exported function and variable names.
3. **Canonical Module Identity:**
   Both whole-program C code generation and separate compilation identify modules by their canonical include-relative
   path (e.g. `util/calc`). When imported using local aliases (such as `import c = util/calc : util/Calc`), client
   C code generates external references to `qv_util__calc` and `qv_util__calc_multiply`, binding the local variable
   `qv_c` to the canonical module record.

### 9.5. Hierarchical Separate Compilation and On-Demand Builds
To maintain high performance, modular boundaries, and clean test separation:
1. **Canonical Hierarchical Identification:**
   A module or interface is classified as hierarchical if and only if its canonical include-relative path contains a
   slash `/` (e.g. `collections/vector`). Modules directly in `lib/` (`list`, `writer`, `conv`, etc.) have flat
   canonical names and remain whole-program / direct source modules.
2. **Phase Partitioning:**
   - Whole-program behavior is preserved for `tokenize`, `parse`, `typecheck`, and `interpret`. The AST interpreter
     evaluates modules directly from source.
   - Separate compilation is always used for hierarchical modules during C phases (`codegen_c` and `run_c_compiled`).
3. **Dependency Building & Build Directory:**
   - In C compilation modes, typechecking only regenerates stale interface artifacts (`.qi`, `.int.h`); importers are typed
     against interfaces. After code generation, the modules the unit needs are built to `.mod.c`, `.o`, and `.qm` by the
     build engine, exactly as in a full application build (see [build-process.md §7.3](build-process.md)).
   - The build output directory can be explicitly specified via `--build-dir <dir>` (such as `.build/` in test runs),
     and defaults to `.build/`.
   - Artifacts are only rebuilt when stale relative to `.int.quest` and `.mod.quest` source modification timestamps
     and the interfaces recorded in `.qm` manifests.
4. **Self-Contained Client External Declarations:**
   - In emitted client C code, the compiler generates self-contained `extern` prototypes for functions, initializers,
     and records of precompiled modules.
   - *Design rationale:* Compiling (as opposed to linking) the importer's C source file does not depend on whether the
     module implementation has already been compiled or on header include paths.
5. **Whole-Program Override:**
   - The `--whole-program` compiler flag overrides this default, forcing the compiler to inline all imported module
     implementations directly into the client C translation unit.

---

## 10. Module Dependency Tracking (`.deps/` and `--emit-deps`)

Builds track module dependencies with `.qm` manifests (see [build-process.md §4](build-process.md)). For use by
external build tools, standalone module compilation can also record them in make-compatible `.d` files; the Quest
build itself does not read them.

### 10.1. Emitting Dependency Files

When compiling modules with `--emit-deps`:
```bash
quest --emit-deps -c lib/util/strutil.mod.quest
```
The compiler creates a `.deps/` subdirectory in the module's target output directory and writes `<stem>.d`:
```make
util/strutil.o: util/maybe.o util/stringbuilder.o collections/vector.o word.o
```
Each entry lists the target `.o` file and its immediate prerequisite module `.o` files.

### 10.2. Transitive Linker Resolution

When the compiler driver links a binary, the build engine follows the `imported_modules` of each module's `.qm`
manifest from the compilation unit's direct imports to form the transitive closure of required objects, rebuilding
stale ones, and supplies them all to clang (see [build-process.md §7](build-process.md)).
