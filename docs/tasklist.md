## Objects compiled with and without the collector share a build directory

**Problem.** A build's staleness check (`unit_staleness`) compares an object with its sources and imports, but not
with whether it was compiled for the collector, so a build with `--nogc` reuses objects that a build without it left
in the same build directory, and the reverse. The objects disagree about allocation, and the link fails (`_GC_init`
undefined) or the program mixes allocators. Both compilers do it.

**Reproduce.** In an empty directory holding `p.quest` (`1 + 1`), `./quest compile p.quest`, then `./quest compile
--nogc p.quest -o n`: the link fails. `./questc` fails the same way.

**Where to start.** `_unit_staleness` in `bootstrap/python/quest/build/engine.py` and `unitStaleness` in
`questlang/build/engine.mod.quest`. Record the collector setting in each unit's `.qm` and treat a unit as stale when
it differs (an ABI change, since the manifest format changes), or keep the two kinds of object apart, in a
subdirectory of the build directory for `--nogc`, as the runtime's objects already are by their flags.

**Done when.** Builds with and without `--nogc` can alternate in one build directory, in both compilers, and a test
does it.
