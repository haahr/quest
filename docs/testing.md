# Quest Compiler Testing Framework

This document describes the testing architecture for the Quest bootstrap compiler, including unit tests, golden-file
end-to-end tests for valid programs, and diagnostic inline-comment tests for invalid programs.

---

## 1. Overview of Test Suites

The compiler test suite is organized into three complementary testing tiers:

1. **Python Unit Tests (`tests/python/`):**
   - Fine-grained unit tests written in Python using `unittest`.
   - Verifies individual compiler modules, functions, algorithms, and data structures:
     - `test_types_and_env.py`: Scopes, symbol tables, kind well-formedness, subkinding.
     - `test_typechecker.py`: Term elaboration, bidirectional typing (`check_expr` / `synth_expr`), contractiveness.
     - `test_diagnostics.py`: Structured diagnostics, `DiagnosticSink`, severities, formatters.
     - `test_typed_ast.py`: Typed AST node constructors, S-expression serialization.
     - `test_phase3_functions.py` through `test_phase6_modules_interfaces.py`: High-level feature-specific tests.
   - Run via:
     ```bash
     PYTHONPATH=bootstrap/python python3 -m unittest discover -s tests/python
     ```

2. **Golden-File Compiler Tests (`tests/source/` and `tests/golden/`):**
   - End-to-end tests for valid Quest programs.
   - Executes the unified compiler driver (`quest_driver.py --stop-after <phase>`) against
     canonical `.quest` source files.
   - Validates stdout against exact expected outputs in `tests/golden/<phase>/<name>.out`.
   - Both the `interpret` phase and the `run_c_compiled` phase compare their stdout against
     the unified `tests/golden/run/` directory.

3. **Diagnostic & Error Tests (`tests/errors/`):**
   - Negative tests for invalid programs containing deliberate syntax, lexical, or type errors.
   - Avoids fragile exact-match terminal formatting goldens by embedding inline expectation directives in comments
     within the source file.
   - Enforces precursor phase validity and strict bidirectional 1:1 matching between expected and actual diagnostics.

      ├── tokenize/ (mirrors tests/source hierarchy)
      ├── parse/    (mirrors tests/source hierarchy)
      ├── typecheck/(mirrors tests/source hierarchy)
      └── run/      (mirrors tests/source hierarchy for interpret and run_c_compiled)
```

Test sources are discovered recursively (`*.quest`), preserving their relative directory paths in `tests/golden/`.

### 2.2. Standard Output and Execution Discipline
- **Valid Programs:** Must complete successfully with exit code 0. Standard output is captured and verified against
  the corresponding `<test>.out` file.
- **Unified Run Directory (`tests/golden/run`):** Both tree-walking interpretation (`interpret`) and native binary
  execution (`run_c_compiled`) produce identical Cardelli interactive outputs and compare against `tests/golden/run/`.
- **`--print-result` Flag:** When invoking `quest_driver.py --stop-after run_c_compiled`, `--print-result` is enabled
  automatically so that the compiled binary outputs the final phrase result. For standalone compilation
  (`quest compile`), binaries are silent by default unless `--print-result` is explicitly passed.
- **Output Streams:**
  - `stdout`: Used exclusively for valid phase artifacts (e.g. token tables, AST S-expressions, typed AST dumps,
    run output).
  - `stderr`: Reserved exclusively for diagnostic error messages and warnings.

### 2.3. Test Runner (`run_tests.py`)
The test runner executes each test source file across active compiler phases via `quest_driver.py`:
- `tokenize`: Runs `quest_driver.py --stop-after tokenize <source_file>`.
- `parse`: Runs `quest_driver.py --stop-after parse <source_file>`.
- `typecheck`: Runs `quest_driver.py --stop-after typecheck <source_file>`.
- `interpret`: Runs `quest_driver.py --stop-after interpret <source_file>` (compared against `tests/golden/run/`).
- `run_c_compiled`: Runs `quest_driver.py --stop-after run_c_compiled <source_file>`
  (compared against `tests/golden/run/`).

**Commands:**
```bash
# Run all golden tests across all phases (tokenize, parse, typecheck, interpret, run_c_compiled)
python3 run_tests.py

# Run only a specific phase
python3 run_tests.py --phase run_c_compiled
python3 run_tests.py --phase interpret

# Run only matching tests
python3 run_tests.py -k 03_functions

# Update golden files after an intentional change
python3 run_tests.py --update-golden
```

If stdout does not match the golden file, `run_tests.py` prints a unified diff detailing the exact mismatch.

**Hermetic builds:** every phase builds into a fresh temporary build directory for each run (shared by the tests of
that run and deleted afterwards), so results never depend on artifacts left by earlier runs or compiler versions.
Pass `--build-dir <dir>` to reuse a build directory across runs for speed. Unit tests that invoke the driver give it
a build directory inside their own temporary directory, so no test writes into the repository.

**ABI corpus:** `tests/python/test_abi_corpus.py` fails when the generated interface artifacts (`.qi` files and C
headers for a frozen snapshot of the library's interfaces) change without a bump of `ABI_VERSION`
(`docs/build-process.md` §5.2.3). After an intended contract change, bump the version and run
`python tests/abi/corpus.py --update`; to snapshot newer library interfaces, run `python tests/abi/corpus.py
--refresh-inputs`.

**Shadow mode:** `--shadow CHECK` (repeatable) runs the compiler with `--shadow-CHECK`, which cross-checks an optimized
type-checker algorithm against its reference implementation and fails on any disagreement; `--shadow all` enables
every check. See `bootstrap/python/quest/shadow.py`.

### 2.4. Phase Skipping Directives (`(* @skip-phase: ... *)`)
For language features that are fully supported in the tree-walking Python interpreter but not yet implemented in the
C compilation backend (or for tests specific to certain phases), tests can include in-file phase skipping directives:

```quest
(* @skip-phase: run_c_compiled *)
```

- **Multiple Phases**: Even though `@skip-phase:` is singular, multiple phases can be omitted using comma- or
  whitespace-separated names (e.g. `(* @skip-phase: run_c_compiled, interpret *)`) or multiple comment directives.
- **Reporting**: Skipped phases are explicitly noted during test execution (`[SKIP] phase:test_name`) and counted in
  the test summary without being counted as failures.
- **Golden Management**: When updating goldens with `--update-golden`, skipped phases are ignored and will not
  generate unexpected `.out` or `.error` files.

### 2.5. Host-Environment Directives (`@args`, `@env`, `@exit`, `@stdin`)
Tests that interact with host OS primitives (command-line arguments, environment variables, exit codes, and standard
input) can specify host execution requirements via top-level comment directives:

- **Command-Line Arguments (`(* @args: ... *)`)**:
  Specifies arguments passed to the program when executing `interpret` or `run_c_compiled`:
  ```quest
  (* @args: hello "world with spaces" *)
  ```
  Arguments are tokenized with standard shell quoting rules and passed after the `--` separator to `quest_driver.py`.
  Available in Quest via `system.args`.

- **Environment Variables (`(* @env: ... *)`)**:
  Sets environment variables for the test process:
  ```quest
  (* @env: QUEST_TEST_ENV_VAR=quest_success_value DEBUG=1 *)
  ```
  Available in Quest via `system.getEnv(...)`.

- **Expected Process Exit Code (`(* @exit: ... *)`)**:
  Specifies the non-zero exit code expected from program execution:
  ```quest
  (* @exit: 42 *)
  ```
  Applies exclusively to execution phases (`interpret` and `run_c_compiled`); earlier phases (`tokenize`, `parse`,
  `typecheck`) must still exit with `0`. The test runner validates that the process exits with the specified code,
  while verifying standard output against `<test>.out`.

- **Process Timeout (`(* @timeout: ... *)`)**:
  Overrides the default per-test timeout (default: 30.0 seconds) for tests that compile large modular suites:
  ```quest
  (* @timeout: 60.0 *)
  ```
  The test runner applies this timeout to each phase invoked for the test.

- **Standard Input (`(* @stdin: ... *)`)**:
  Supplies standard input data to the running program using a multi-line comment block:
  ```quest
  (* @stdin:
  First input line
  Second input line
  *)
  ```
  Available in Quest via `reader.input`.

## 3. Diagnostic & Error Testing Framework (`tests/errors/`)

### 3.1. Design Motivation
Exact-match golden files for error reporting are fragile: cosmetic adjustments to terminal box-drawing characters,
line gutters, column pointers, color ANSI sequences, or minor wording changes in help text break all golden files,
even when compiler diagnostic semantics remain correct.

The diagnostic testing framework tests errors semantically using **inline expectation comments** directly inside the
failing test source files.

### 3.2. Directory Structure and Phase Scoping

Error tests are organized by the specific compiler phase responsible for detecting and reporting the error:

```
tests/errors/
  ├── tokenize/
  │   ├── invalid_character.quest
  │   └── unclosed_string.quest
  ├── parse/
  │   ├── missing_end.quest
  │   └── invalid_infix.quest
  └── typecheck/
      ├── non_contractive_rec.quest
      ├── record_field_mismatch.quest
      └── unhandled_exception.quest
```

### 3.3. Inline Expectation Syntax

Expected diagnostics are declared using standard Quest block comments (`(* ... *)`) placed directly on the line where
the diagnostic is expected:

```
(* <SEVERITY>: <REGEXP> *)
```

- `<SEVERITY>`: One of `ERROR`, `WARNING`, `INFO`, `FATAL` (case-insensitive).
- `<REGEXP>`: A regular expression pattern matched against the diagnostic's primary `message`, `notes`, or `help_text`.

#### Examples
```quest
(* tests/errors/typecheck/non_contractive_rec.quest *)
Let Rec Bad::TYPE = Bad; (* ERROR: not contractive *)

(* tests/errors/typecheck/type_mismatch.quest *)
let x: Int = "hello"; (* ERROR: type mismatch.*expected 'Int' *)

(* tests/errors/typecheck/warnings.quest *)
let unused = 42; (* WARNING: unused variable 'unused' *)
```

### 3.4. Precursor Phase Validation
A test in `tests/errors/<phase>/` must contain errors **only in `<phase>`**.

When running a test for `<phase>`:
1. The runner executes all precursor phases in order (e.g. for `typecheck`, it first runs `tokenize` and `parse`).
2. If any precursor phase produces an error, the test fails immediately:
   ```
   [FAIL] typecheck:tests/errors/typecheck/bad_syntax.quest
     Precursor phase 'parse' failed unexpectedly before reaching 'typecheck':
     test.quest:2:5: error: syntax error, expected 'end'
   ```
This enforces independence of concerns and ensures tests do not pass accidentally due to earlier unintended failures.

### 3.5. Bidirectional 1:1 Diagnostic Matching
To prevent silent regressions (such as cascading poison errors or unverified warnings), the runner enforces exact
bidirectional matching:

1. **Every Expected Diagnostic Must Be Found:** Every inline expectation `(* SEVERITY: REGEXP *)` on line $N$ must
   match an actual diagnostic emitted with that severity on line $N$.
2. **Every Actual Diagnostic Must Be Expected:** Every diagnostic emitted by the compiler in the tested phase must
   match one of the declared inline expectations.
3. If any expected diagnostic is missing, or any unexpected diagnostic is emitted, the test fails with a clear diff.

## 5. Test Suite Performance

### 5.1. Where the Time Goes
Measured 2026-10-06 on the full golden and error suites (about 160 s in total, each phase timed separately with a
fresh build directory):

| Part | Time | Notes |
| :--- | ---: | :--- |
| `run_c_compiled` (58 tests) | 77 s | Every link recompiles the C runtime (~0.4 s); includes the cold `ast`/`astprint` module build |
| Error suite (85 tests) | 42 s | Each test starts the compiler 2-5 times (precursor phases plus the target phase) |
| `typecheck` / `interpret` | 14 s / 14 s | |
| `tokenize` / `parse` | 7 s / 7 s | Almost entirely process startup |

Starting one compiler process costs about 0.12 s (mostly importing the `quest` package), and a full run starts roughly
370 processes for the golden tests, plus more for the error tests.

### 5.2. Possible Speedups (largest first)
1. **Run tests in parallel.** `run_tests.py` runs one test at a time. Six to eight workers could plausibly bring the
   suite under a minute. The shared build directory then needs care: either build the library modules once before
   starting the workers, or give each worker its own build directory.
2. **Build the C runtime once per run.** Every link recompiles `runtime/quest_runtime.c` and
   `runtime/quest_serialization.c` from source at `-O2` (about 0.39 s), costing roughly 25-30 s across the C tests and
   C error tests. Compiling them once into the build directory and linking the object files would recover most of it.
3. **Avoid redundant precursor runs in error tests.** Each error test first reruns every earlier phase in its own
   process to confirm that it passes (section 3.4), although the target-phase run already executes those phases in the
   same process. If the target run's diagnostics recorded which phase failed, one process per test would suffice,
   probably cutting the error suite by half to two-thirds.
4. **Reuse build artifacts safely.** `--build-dir .build` already skips rebuilding library modules, but it is only safe
   once compiled artifacts record the compiler version that produced them, so that a compiler change invalidates them.
