# C Code Generator and Host Compilation Architecture (`codegen_c`)

This document specifies the architecture, code generation rules, statement-expression lowerings, and host compiler
driver for **Step 4: Bootstrap C Transpiler** (`bootstrap/python/quest/codegen/`).

---

## 1. Overview and Architecture

The C code generation phase (`CodegenCPhase`, canonical name `codegen_c`) translates a type-checked Quest AST
(`TypedProgram`) into portable C99 source code, which is then compiled into a native binary executable by invoking
the host C toolchain (`clang` or `gcc`).

```

### Module Structure (`bootstrap/python/quest/codegen/`)
- **`c_types.py`:** C scalar type mappings, identifier mangling (`qv_<name>`), operator name mangling, and type names.
- **`c_emitter.py`:** Core AST visitor class `CEmitter` generating C99 code for phrases, bindings, and expressions.
- **`compiler_runner.py`:** Discovers host compiler, auto-detects Boehm GC, compiles C source, and runs binaries.
- **`__init__.py`:** Package exports (`CEmitter`, `compile_c_source`, `run_binary`).

---

## 2. Type Mapping and Identifier Mangling (`c_types.py`)

### 2.1. Scalar Type Mapping
Quest scalar types map to native C99 types defined in `runtime/quest_runtime.h`:

| Quest Type | C Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Int` | `QInt` (`int64_t`) | 64-bit signed integer |
| `Real` | `QReal` (`double`) | 64-bit IEEE-754 double precision float |
| `Bool` | `QBool` (`bool`) | C99 boolean (`true` / `false`) |
| `Char` | `QChar` (`char`) | 8-bit character (extended in 64-bit word when in `QVal`) |
| `String` | `QString *` | Pointer to heap-allocated string descriptor |
| `Ok` | `void` / `QVal` | Statement completion indicator (`Q_OK_VAL`) |
| Polymorphic / Generic | `QVal` | Uniform 64-bit value word union |

### 2.2. Identifier Namespacing and Name Mangling
To prevent collisions with C99 keywords (`int`, `return`, `default`, `static`, etc.), standard library symbols,
and C struct member keywords, Quest applies a comprehensive, deterministic name mangling scheme:
- **Value and variable names** are prefixed with `qv_` (e.g. `qv_x`, `qv_default`).
- **Record field names** inside C structs are prefixed with `qf_` (e.g. `qf_default`, `qf_x`).
- **Hierarchical module paths** are flattened using `__` (e.g. `util/path` $\rightarrow$ `util__path`).
- **Symbolic operators** are mapped via `SYMBOL_MANGLE_MAP` with prefix `qv_sym_`
  (e.g. `:=` $\rightarrow$ `qv_sym_colon_equals`).
- **Temporary variable names** are generated uniquely with fresh counters (e.g. `_res_1`, `_tuple_2`).

## 3. Program Structure and Code Emission (`c_emitter.py`)

### 3.1. Program Boilerplate
`CEmitter.emit_program()` emits a standalone C99 compilation unit containing:
1. Preamble include: `#include "quest_runtime.h"`
2. Entry point: `int main(int argc, char **argv)`
3. Runtime initialization: `quest_gc_init()` (initializes Boehm GC or no-op if `-DQUEST_NOGC`)
4. Sequential emission of all top-level phrases.
5. Exit: `return 0;`

```c
/* Emitted by Quest Bootstrap C Transpiler */
#include "quest_runtime.h"

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    (void)argc; (void)argv;
    quest_gc_init();

    /* Top-level phrases */
    ...

    return 0;
}
```

### 3.2. Let Bindings and Variables
- **Immutable Bindings (`TypedLetValue` with `is_var=False`):**
  Emitted directly as a typed C local variable:
  ```c
  /* let x = 42; */
  QInt qv_x = (42LL);
  ```
- **Mutable Bindings (`TypedLetValue` with `is_var=True`):**
  Emitted as a standard C variable:
  ```c
  /* let var count = 0; */
  QInt qv_count = (0LL);
  ```
- **Assignment Mutation (`TypedAssign`):**
  ```c
  /* count := count + 1; */
  qv_count = ((qv_count) + (1LL));
  ```

### 3.3. Cardelli Non-Overloaded Operators
In Quest, operators are strictly non-overloaded (§4.2). The transpiler emits direct C99 expressions:

- **Integer Arithmetic:** `+`, `-`, `*` map to C `+`, `-`, `*`.
- **Integer Division & Modulo:** `/` and `%` call inline runtime functions with zero-divisor checks:
  ```c
  /* 42 / x */
  quest_int_div(42LL, qv_x)
  /* 42 % x */
  quest_int_mod(42LL, qv_x)
  ```
- **Real Arithmetic (Doubled Symbols):** each calls a runtime function that raises `real.error` instead of producing
  a NaN ([type-system.md](type-system.md) §6.3.1):
  - `++` $\rightarrow$ `quest_real_add((l), (r))`
  - `--` $\rightarrow$ `quest_real_sub((l), (r))`
  - `**` $\rightarrow$ `quest_real_mul((l), (r))`
  - `//` $\rightarrow$ `quest_real_divide((l), (r))` (also raises for a zero divisor)
  - `^^` (exponentiation) $\rightarrow$ `quest_real_pow((l), (r))` (also raises for a zero base and negative exponent)
  - An infinite literal is emitted as `INFINITY` or `(-INFINITY)`.
- **Relational Comparisons:**
  - Integer: `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`
  - Real: `<<` $\rightarrow$ `<`, `<<=` $\rightarrow$ `<=`, `>>` $\rightarrow$ `>`, `>>=` $\rightarrow$ `>=`
- **Identity and Equality:**
  - `is` and `==` map to C `==` (for scalars) or `quest_string_equal` (for strings).
  - `isnot` maps to C `!=` (or `!quest_string_equal`).
  - On a value represented as `QVal` (a type parameter or abstract type), `is` becomes
    `quest_val_is(descriptor, l, r)`, which compares bits and, for a `Real`, the doubles, so that `0.0 is ~0.0`
    holds in polymorphic code too. A type with no runtime descriptor passes `NULL` and compares bits.
- **String Concatenation:**
  - `<>` calls `quest_string_concat(s1, s2)`.

---

## 4. Control Flow and Standard C99 Lowering

Because Quest is an expression-oriented language, constructs like `if`, `begin ... end`, and loops can appear in
arbitrary expression positions (e.g. `let x = if c then 1 else 2 end;`).

To lower these into strict, portable **standard ISO C99** without relying on non-standard GCC/Clang statement
expressions (`({ ... })`), the transpiler employs destination-passing statement lowering:
- Expressions evaluating in statement context (e.g. bindings, returns, or phrase sequences) emit directly into their
  destination.
- Control constructs (`if`, loops, blocks) decompose into standard C99 statements and blocks (`{ ... }`).
- When a complex expression appears as a sub-expression (e.g. inside an arithmetic operation), temporary variables
  are hoisted and emitted as preparation statements immediately preceding the consumer.

### 4.1. Conditionals (`TypedIf`)
- **Value-Producing If Expression:**
  ```c
  /* let x = if a > 0 then 10 else 20 end; */
  if ((qv_a) > (0LL)) {
      qv_x = 10LL;
  } else {
      qv_x = 20LL;
  }
  ```
- **Statement / Ok-typed If:**
  ```c
  if (cond) {
      then_body;
  } else {
      else_body;
  }
  ```

### 4.2. Sequential Blocks (`TypedBlock`)
A block scopes local variable declarations and evaluates to its destination inside standard C braces:
```c
/* begin let a = 5; let b = 6; a * b end */
{
    QInt qv_a;
    qv_a = 5LL;
    QInt qv_b;
    qv_b = 6LL;
    dest = ((qv_a) * (qv_b));
}
```

### 4.3. While and Infinite Loops (`TypedWhile`, `TypedLoop`, `TypedExit`)
- **`while <cond> do <body> end`:**
  Emitted as standard C `while (1)` with condition checking and early break:
  ```c
  while (1) {
      if (!(cond)) break;
      body;
  }
  ```
- **`loop <body> end`:**
  ```c
  while (1) {
      body;
  }
  ```
- **`exit`:**
  Emitted directly as `break;`.

### 4.4. For Loops (`TypedFor`)
Quest provides both ascending (`upto`) and descending (`downto`) loops, emitted as standard C99 `for` loops:
- **`for i = 1 upto 5 do <body> end`:**
  ```c
  QInt _stop_1 = 5LL;
  for (QInt qv_i = 1LL; qv_i <= _stop_1; qv_i++) {
      body;
  }
  ```
- **`for i = 5 downto 1 do <body> end`:**
  ```c
  QInt _stop_1 = 1LL;
  for (QInt qv_i = 5LL; qv_i >= _stop_1; qv_i--) {
      body;
  }
  ```

---

## 5. Functions & Direct Calling Conventions (Phase 4.2a)

### 5.1. Function Declaration Hoisting & Static Scope
Top-level function definitions (`let f(...) = ...`, `let rec f(...) = ...`) are hoisted out of `main()` to C file scope:
- **Top-Level Variable Hoisting:** Non-function top-level variables (`let x = 10;`) are declared as file-scope static C
  variables (`static QInt qv_x;`) and initialized inside `main()` in program order, ensuring top-level functions can
  read and mutate them.
- **Prototypes & Forward Declarations:** Before emitting function definitions, the transpiler generates static forward
  declarations for all top-level functions:
  ```c
  static QInt qv_factorial(QInt qv_n);
  ```
  This allows recursive and mutually referenced functions to compile without order dependency.

### 5.2. Direct Calling Convention & Currying Flattening
- **Uncurried Signatures:** Functions defined with multi-parameter or curried syntax are flattened into direct,
  zero-overhead uncurried C function signatures:
  ```c
  /* let add(x: Int y: Int): Int = x + y; */
  static QInt qv_add(QInt qv_x, QInt qv_y) {
      return ((qv_x) + (qv_y));
  }
  ```
- **Application Flattening:** Fully applied call sites (`add(10 20)` or `add(10)(20)`) are flattened into direct
  C invocations `qv_add(10LL, 20LL)`.
- **`Ok` Return Types:** Functions returning `Ok` emit `void` return types and clean `return;` statements. At statement
  call sites, calls returning `Ok` are emitted directly as statement calls: `qv_proc(...);`.

---

## 6. Tuples & Concrete Records (Phase 4.2b)

Phase 4.2b introduces standard C99 code generation for tuples and concrete records with heap allocation, uniform 64-bit
slot layout, and direct pointer-based field access.

### 6.1. C Struct Layout & Tag Generation
- **Positional Tuple Structs:** Tuple types map to positional members `_0`, `_1`, ... based on their component value
  fields (`t.value_fields`). Struct names are deterministic and reflect component types:
  ```c
  /* Tuple x: Int y: Real end */
  typedef struct QTuple_Int_Real QTuple_Int_Real;

  struct QTuple_Int_Real {
      QInt _0;
      QReal _1;
  };
  ```
- **Canonical Alphabetized Record Structs:** Records are unordered product types with structural equivalence. To ensure
  structurally identical record types share the same C struct definition, record struct members are sorted
  alphabetically by field name, prefixed with `qf_` (to avoid C keyword collisions):
  ```c
  /* record x = 10, y = 20.0 end */
  typedef struct QRecord_x_Int_y_Real QRecord_x_Int_y_Real;

  struct QRecord_x_Int_y_Real {
      QInt qf_x;
      QReal qf_y;
  };
  ```
- **Forward Typedef Hoisting:** The transpiler recursively discovers all `QTupleType` and `QRecordType` instances
  across the AST and emits forward declarations (`typedef struct Tag Tag;`) before any struct bodies, static variables,
  or function prototypes. This guarantees that mutually referencing or nested aggregate types compile cleanly without
  ordering dependencies.

### 6.2. Heap Allocation & Member Initialization
Tuples and records are heap-allocated via `quest_alloc(sizeof(StructTag))` (managed by Boehm GC or standard `calloc`
in `--nogc` mode):
```c
/* origin = tuple let x = 0 let y = 0.0 end */
qv_origin = (QTuple_Int_Real *)quest_alloc(sizeof(QTuple_Int_Real));
qv_origin->_0 = 0LL;
qv_origin->_1 = 0.0;
```
When an aggregate expression appears in a value context (e.g. passed directly to a function call or returned from an
expression), a local temporary pointer is allocated and returned.

### 6.3. Field Selection & Mutable Field Assignment
- **Selection (`TypedSelect`):**
  - For tuples: Named fields are mapped to their 0-based value component index at compile-time (`p.x` -> `qv_p->_0`).
    Unnamed fields accessed by index also map directly (`t._0` -> `qv_t->_0`).
  - For records: Field accesses map directly to the mangled field name (`r.x` -> `qv_r->qf_x`).
- **Mutable Assignment (`TypedAssign`):**
  - When the target of `TypedAssign` is a `TypedSelect` expression on a mutable record field (`var y = ...`), the
    target expression is evaluated as an lvalue pointer dereference, storing the value directly into the heap struct:
  ```c
  /* r.y := 42; */
  qv_r->qf_y = 42LL;
  ```

---

## 7. Closures, Function Values & Lambda Lifting (Phase 4.2c)

In Quest, functions are first-class values that can be passed to higher-order functions, returned from functions,
and capture variables from enclosing lexical scopes.

### 7.1. Closure Representation (`QClosure`)
First-class function values use the uniform 16-byte `QClosure` struct defined in `runtime/quest_runtime.h`:
```c
typedef struct QClosure {
    void *fn;   /* C function pointer: RetType (*)(void *env, ...) */
    void *env;  /* Captured environment struct pointer or NULL */
} QClosure;

static_assert(sizeof(QClosure) == 16, qclosure_must_be_16_bytes);
static_assert(offsetof(QClosure, env) == 8, qclosure_env_at_offset_8);
```

### 7.2. Direct Top-Level Calls vs. Trampoline Adapters
1. **Direct Top-Level Calls:** Direct calls to statically known top-level functions remain zero-overhead standard C
   function calls (`qv_f(args...)`) without passing an unused `env` pointer.
2. **First-Class Value Passing:** When a top-level function is referenced as a value (e.g., passed to an argument
   expecting `QFunType`), the transpiler synthesizes a static trampoline adapter and a file-scope static `QClosure`:
   ```c
   static QInt qv_add1_trampoline(void *env, QInt qv_x) {
       (void)env;
       return qv_add1(qv_x);
   }
   static QClosure qv_add1_closure = { (void *)qv_add1_trampoline, NULL };
   ```
   Passing `add1` in expression context emits `(&qv_add1_closure)` directly without heap allocation.

### 7.3. Lambda Lifting & Flat Environment Frames
Inner `TypedFun` expressions undergo free variable analysis (`_find_free_vars`):
1. **Capturing Lambdas:**
   - A dedicated flat environment struct `struct QEnv_<lid> { ... }` is generated containing the captured types.
   - The lambda body is lifted to file scope as `static RetType qv_<lid>(void *_raw_env, Params...)`.
   - At the instantiation site, the environment and a `QClosure` are allocated on the heap via `quest_alloc`:
     ```c
     struct QEnv_lambda_1 *_env = (struct QEnv_lambda_1 *)quest_alloc(sizeof(struct QEnv_lambda_1));
     _env->qv_x = qv_x;
     QClosure *_clos = (QClosure *)quest_alloc(sizeof(QClosure));
     _clos->fn = (void *)qv_lambda_1;
     _clos->env = (void *)_env;
     ```
   - A local recursive function (`let rec f ...`, or the members of `let rec f ... and g ...`) captures its own
     variable and those of the other members, which hold no value yet when its closure is built. Every member's
     variable is declared first, and those captures are copied into the environments only after every member has
     been assigned (`_emit_rec_bindings`).
   - A local binding is emitted with its value computed before its variable is declared. Its variable is the
     binding's mangled name, or a fresh identifier (which the name then stands for in the rest of the block) when
     the block already declares the name, which C cannot redeclare, or when the value refers to the binding it
     shadows (`let n = n + 1`), since a C variable is in scope in its own initialization (`_declare_local`). The
     members of a simultaneous declaration (`let x = ... and y = ...`) compute every value into a temporary before
     any member's variable is declared (`_emit_simultaneous_bindings`), and likewise at the top level and in module
     initializers, before any member's global is assigned.
2. **Non-Capturing Lambdas:**
   - Lifted to file scope with `(void)_raw_env;`.
   - Emits a static singleton closure `static QClosure qv_<lid>_closure = { (void *)qv_<lid>, NULL };` and passes
     `&qv_<lid>_closure`, avoiding heap allocations entirely.

### 7.4. Indirect Closure Invocations
When calling an indirect target (such as a closure parameter or returned function), the call site casts `fn` to the
expected C function pointer signature and passes `env` as the first argument:
```c
((QInt (*)(void *, QInt))(qv_f->fn))(qv_f->env, qv_x)
```

---

## 8. Arrays and Strings (Phase 4.3)

### 8.1. Array Representation (`QArray`)
Arrays are mutable buffers of 64-bit `QVal` words with an explicit length prefix:
```c
typedef struct QArray {
    int64_t length;
    QVal    data[];
} QArray;

static_assert(offsetof(QArray, data) == 8, qarray_data_at_offset_8);
```

### 8.2. Allocation and Construction
- **Explicit Element Lists (`TypedArray`):**
  Allocates the structure and populates each element wrapped as a `QVal`:
  ```c
  QArray *qv_arr = (QArray *)quest_alloc(sizeof(QArray) + (size_t)(4LL) * sizeof(QVal));
  qv_arr->length = 4LL;
  qv_arr->data[0LL] = ((QVal){ .i = (int64_t)(10LL) });
  ...
  ```
- **Repetition (`TypedArrayRep`):**
  Invokes `quest_array_new(length, init_val)` which verifies $N \ge 0$ and initializes all elements.

### 8.3. Indexing and Mutation
Array indexing (`a[i]`) and mutation (`a[i] := v`) emit inline bounds checking followed by direct access into `data[]`:
```c
quest_check_array_bounds(qv_arr, qv_i);
QInt elem = qv_arr->data[qv_i].i;

quest_check_array_bounds(qv_arr, qv_i);
qv_arr->data[qv_i] = ((QVal){ .i = (int64_t)(99LL) });
```
Out-of-bounds indices and negative sizes trigger `quest_raise_array_error()`, printing `Exception: arrayOp.error\n`
and terminating with exit code 1.

---

## 9. Options and Variants (Sums) (Phase 4.4)

### 9.1. Option Types
Option types are ordered sums with inline union payloads. Each unique `QOptionType` synthesizes:
- A tag enumeration: `QTAG_<Option>_<branch> = <index>`.
- A C struct containing `int64_t tag` and an inline union of branch structs for branches carrying components:
  ```c
  typedef struct QOption_... {
      int64_t tag;
      union {
          struct { QInt _0; } branch1;
          ...
      } u;
  } QOption_...;
  ```

### 9.2. Variant Types
Variant types are unordered sums with a single 64-bit payload word, represented as first-class 16-byte values:
```c
typedef struct QVariantVal {
    int64_t tag;
    QVal    payload;
} QVariantVal;

static_assert(sizeof(QVariantVal) == 16, qvariantval_must_be_16_bytes);
static_assert(offsetof(QVariantVal, tag) == 0, qvariantval_tag_at_offset_0);
static_assert(offsetof(QVariantVal, payload) == 8, qvariantval_payload_at_offset_8);
```

### 9.3. Injections, Tag Queries, Extractions, and Pattern Matching
- **Injection:** `option b of T with payload end` allocates and populates the union branch; `variant b of T with v end`
  constructs an unboxed `QVariantVal` compound literal directly with zero heap allocations.
- **Tag Query (`target?tag`):** Checks `target.tag == EXPECTED_TAG` on variants (or `target->tag == EXPECTED_TAG`
  on options).
- **Tag Assertion (`target!tag`):** Asserts tag match (panics with `Exception: variant.tagMismatch\n` on failure).
  Returns `payload` for variants, or a `QTuple` prepending the ordinal for options.
- **Pattern Matching (`case`):** Lowers to standard C `switch (target.tag)` (or `target->tag` for options) with
  branch payload binders.

---

## 10. Structural Subtyping & Dynamic Dispatch (Phase 4.5)

Phase 4.5 implements Cardelli's structural subtyping across tuples, records, and variants:

### 10.1. Prefix Tuple Subtyping
- **Direct Pointer Coercion:** A wider tuple pointer `QT_Triple *` is cast directly to a prefix tuple `(QT_Pair *)`.
- **Memoized Compile-Time Layout Verification:**
  ```c
  static_assert(offsetof(QT_Triple, _0) == offsetof(QT_Pair, _0), tuple_subtyping_offset_match_0);
  static_assert(offsetof(QT_Triple, _1) == offsetof(QT_Pair, _1), tuple_subtyping_offset_match_1);
  ```

### 10.2. Evidence-Passing Record Subtyping
- **Object Header:** Every concrete record structure begins with `QRecordHeader header;` at offset 0, set at
  allocation to the descriptor of the record's layout (`header.descriptor = &quest_type_QT_Point;`).
- **Polymorphic Call Arguments:** For a call with type arguments, each argument is first coerced to its parameter's
  type with the type arguments substituted (so `f(:Small big)` passes a `Small` view), then to the generic
  representation of the parameter.
- **Offset Table Map:** `main` registers each static `offsetdict_<Target>_<Source>` with
  `quest_register_record_dict(&quest_type_<Target>, &quest_type_<Source>, &offsetdict_<Target>_<Source>)`; tables
  for other (view, layout) pairs are built by the runtime on demand (`quest_record_dict`).
- **First-Class Fat Pointers (`QRecordVal`):** All records are represented uniformly as a 16-byte struct:
  ```c
  typedef struct QRecordVal {
      void       *val;   /* Pointer to heap-allocated QT_<Record> payload */
      const void *dict;  /* Pointer to static OffsetDict_<Record> */
  } QRecordVal;
  ```
- **Function Parameters & Returns:** Functions take `QRecordVal` directly and return `QRecordVal` directly
  (passed in `x0, x1` under AAPCS64), eliminating companion dictionary arguments.
- **Dictionary Naming:** Uses alias name when available (`OffsetDict_<Alias>`), or sequential per-module identifier
  `OffsetDict_<Module>_record<N>` / `OffsetDict_record<N>`.
- **Field Selection:** Dynamic dispatch reads fields via byte offsets from embedded dictionaries:
  ```c
  (*((QInt *)((char *)qv_pt.val + ((const OffsetDict_Point2D *)qv_pt.dict)->offset_x)))
  ```
- **Aggregate Storage:** Records and variants in tuples are stored inline as 16-byte values (`QRecordVal` and
  `QVariantVal`). In arrays (`QArray`), they are boxed into 8-byte heap pointers (`QRecordVal *`, `QVariantVal *`)
  via `quest_record_box` and `quest_variant_box`, setting the stage for future unboxed multi-stride arrays.
  Subtyped variants in aggregates apply static tag remapping (`tagmap_<Target>_<Source>`) at insertion time.

### 10.3. Variant Subtyping & Static Tag Remapping
- **First-Class Value Representation:** `QVariantVal` is a 16-byte value type (`int64_t tag; QVal payload;`).
  Variant creation, checks (`v?x`), assertions (`v!x`), and `case` pattern matching execute with zero heap allocations.
- **Static Tag Tables:** Static lookup tables in `.rodata` translate source tags to target tags:
  ```c
  static const int64_t tagmap_Large_Small[] = { 2LL, 1LL };
  ```
- **Zero-Allocation Upcast:** Coercion emits an unboxed compound literal:
  `((QVariantVal){ .tag = tagmap_Large_Small[src.tag], .payload = src.payload })`.

### 10.4. Bounded Specialization for Records and Variants (Phase 4.9b)
- **Runtime Descriptor Retention:** Bounded polymorphic functions retain `const QTypeDescriptor *descriptor_<T>`
  parameters in their C signatures to facilitate separate compilation and uniform reflection.
- **Bounded Record Parameters & Field Selection:** Functions expecting `A <: Record` receive `QRecordVal` directly.
  Field selection `p.x` dynamically indexes through the passed-in dictionary:
  `((const OffsetDict_Bound *)p.dict)->offset_x`.
- **Caller Dictionary Restoration on Return:** When returning a bounded type variable `A <: Record`, the caller
  restores the dictionary (`Option A: Caller Restores Dictionary`), attaching the identity dictionary `&offsetdict_T_T`
  of the concrete type argument `T` to the returned `.val`.
- **Bounded Variant Parameters & Call-Site Tag Alignment:** Callers align variant tags to the bound variant type using
  static `.rodata` tag tables into an unboxed compound literal, allowing callees to switch directly on `v.tag` without
  runtime translation or heap allocation.

### 10.5. Call-Site Specialization for Unbounded Quantifiers (Phase 4.9c)
When unbounded polymorphic functions (`All(A::TYPE)`) are invoked at call sites with concrete `Record` or `Variant`
arguments:
- **Specialization Analysis Pass (`c_analysis.py`):** Scans the AST worklist for call sites where type arguments
  require specialization (`is_specialization_needed`). Clones the `TypedFun` node with substituted types, synthesizes
  specialized identifier `qv_<name>_spec_<type_tags>`, and populates aggregate types from cloned bodies.
- **Direct Calling Convention & Zero-Boxing:** Specialized function clones take unboxed `QRecordVal` and `QVariantVal`
  parameters directly without descriptor parameters (unless uninstantiated quantifiers remain) and pass them in
  register pairs `(x0, x1)` without heap boxing.
- **Struct Layout Alignment:** Generic tuples within specialized clones instantiate concrete C structs
  (`struct QTuple_<TypeTags>`) with 16-byte inline slots matching caller expectations, eliminating pointer mismatches.
- **First-Class Fallback:** The canonical unspecialized `QVal` version is retained for indirect calls and closures.

### 10.6. Flat Stride Arrays (Phase 4.9d)
Arrays containing records or variants (`Array(Record)` and `Array(Variant)`) are lowered to specialized wide array
structures (`QArrayWideRecord` and `QArrayWideVariant`):
- **Flat 16-Byte Stride Buffers:** Elements are stored directly in contiguous memory buffers without individual
  heap boxing (`quest_record_box` / `quest_variant_box`).
- **In-Place Read and Write:** Indexing (`arr[i]`) and assignment (`arr[i] := val`) operate directly on 16-byte
  slots in-place, passing and returning values in register pairs `(x0, x1)` with zero heap allocation.
- **Subtyping Coercion at Insertion:** Inserting a subtyped record or variant into an array evaluates evidence
  dictionary attachment or static tag remapping at insertion time and stores the result flat in the array slot.
- **Interaction with Call-Site Specialization:** Generic functions operating on `Array(A)` where `A` is a record
  or variant specialize to concrete clones that access flat wide arrays directly.

### 10.7. Unified Native Module Mechanism & Hybrid Modules (Phase 4.11)
All modules—whether pure Quest, standard library built-ins (`writer`, `reader`, `conv`, `ascii`, `int`, `real`,
`string`, `system`, `arrayOp`, `dynamic`), or user-defined hybrid modules—are compiled uniformly:
- **Unified Pipeline (Section 8b Emission):** Legacy Section 8c and ad-hoc string matching
  (`_builtin_call_c_expr` / `_builtin_val_c_expr`) are eliminated. All modules emit uniform declarations in
  `c_declarations.py` and module initializers/trampolines in Section 8b of `c_emitter.py`.
- **Topological Lazy Initializers (`qv_mod_<name>_init`):**
  - Each module emits an initialization function guarded by `qv_mod_<name>_initialized` for idempotent execution.
  - Recursively triggers initializers of dependency modules in topological order before executing local bindings.
  - Allocates the module payload struct (`QT_<Interface>`) and populates all exported fields with **concrete values**:
    - Native bindings (`TypedNativeBinding`) and pure Quest functions emit static trampolines
      (`qv_<mod>_<fn>_trampoline`) with `(void)arg_{i}` unused parameter suppression, wrapped in `QClosure *` objects.
    - Native constants (`TypedExternal`) and evaluated `let` bindings populate fields directly, wrapping in `QVal`
      (`_qval_wrap`) if the interface field is abstract.
- **Direct Native Call Lowering & Polymorphic Native Bindings:** When selecting a function on a known module
  (e.g. `writer.putString(w s)`), the compiler resolves the native binding and directly emits
  `quest_writer_put_string(...)` or expands the inline template, bypassing closure allocation and indirect calls.
  Polymorphic native functions that inspect runtime types (e.g. `dynamic.new`, `dynamic.be`) set
  `pass_type_descriptors=True` on their `TypedNativeBinding`, receiving caller-synthesized `QTypeDescriptor *`
  arguments automatically. All `dynamic` operations (`dynamic.new`, `dynamic.be`, `dynamic.copy`, `dynamic.extern`,
  `dynamic.intern`) are standard `TypedNativeBinding`s with zero compiler special-casing.
- **External C Types and Values:** `external "C_TYPE"` and `external "C_SYMBOL"` seamlessly bridge C runtime
  structures (e.g. `QWriter *`, `QReader *`) into Quest's type system without compiler special-casing.

### 10.8. Mutable Reference Parameters (`out` and `var`) and `@` Lvalues (Phase 4.12)
Phase 4.12 implements native pointer lowering for Cardelli's mutable reference parameters:
- **Native Pointer Parameters (`T *`):** Parameters marked `var p: T` or `out p: T` compile directly to
  `T *qv_p` in C declarations, definitions, and closure trampolines. Reads from `var` parameters dereference the
  pointer (`*qv_p`), and writes to `var`/`out` parameters assign through the pointer (`*qv_p = val;`).
- **Callsite Lvalue Emission (`@`):**
  - Variable references `@x` emit `&qv_x`.
  - Pointer parameter forwarding `g(@y)` directly passes `qv_y` without taking its address (`&`).
  - Record field references `@r.f` emit pointers into the heap record buffer
    (`(({fld_t} *)((char *)rec.val + offset))`).
  - Array element references `@a[i]` emit pointers into the flat array buffer (`&arr->data[i]`).
  - Tuple element references `@t.1` emit pointers to tuple components (`&tup->_1`).
  - Temporary cells `var(e)` evaluate `e` into a stack local and pass its address (`&_var_cell`).
- **Polymorphic Reference Invocations (Two-Tier Model):**
  - **Tier 1 (Specialization):** Direct calls in the compilation unit trigger AST specialization in `c_analysis.py`.
    The specialized function takes native `T *qv_p` parameters, passing lvalue pointers directly without overhead.
  - **Tier 2 (Shadow Cell Fallback):** When calling unspecialized polymorphic functions (`var p: A` where `qv_p` is
    `QVal *`), the caller generates a stack shadow cell `QVal _shadow_cell`. For `var` parameters, it performs copy-in
    via `_qval_wrap(*_loc_ptr, T)` (boxing 16-byte `QRecordVal` fat pointers and `QVariantVal`), passes `&_shadow_cell`
    to the callee, and performs copy-out writeback `*_loc_ptr = _qval_unwrap(_shadow_cell, T)` after return.
- **Closure Capture Restrictions:** Closure capture of `out`/`var` parameters or local stack mutable variables
  is prohibited at compile time, guaranteeing that pointers never outlive their stack frames.

### 10.9. Existential Tuples & Dot-Projections (Phase 4.13)
Phase 4.13 implements existential tuples (weak sums `Tuple A::TYPE ... end`), path-type projection (`p.T`),
and member projection (`p.v`):
- **Struct Layout & Type Formal Erasure:** In static compilation, type formal components (`A::TYPE`, `A <: T`) are
  erased from the physical C struct layout. Positional value indices (`_0`, `_1`, etc.) correspond strictly to the
  tuple's value components.
- **Bounded Path-Type Native Lowering (`resolve_type_bound`):**
  - Unbounded type variables and path-types (`A::TYPE`, `p.T`) map to uniform 64-bit `QVal`. Scalar values are boxed
    via `qval_wrap` and unboxed via `qval_unwrap`.
  - Bounded type variables and path-types (`A::POWER(T)`, `p.T <: T`) unbox directly to the bound's native C type
    (e.g., `QInt`, `QReal`), eliminating dynamic boxing and preserving full native performance.
- **Closure Adaptation Thunks (`_emit_closure_adaptation`):** When packaging or coercing a tuple containing closures
  whose concrete signatures differ from the abstract interface signature (e.g., `create(init: Int): Counter` where
  `Counter = Int` coerced to `create(init: Int): A`), the transpiler synthesizes static adaptation thunks
  (`qv_adapt_<id>`). The thunk unpacks/forwards the original closure's environment, unwraps any `QVal` arguments with
  `qval_unwrap`, invokes the underlying native function, and wraps any abstract return value with `qval_wrap`. A thunk
  is also made when a closure is used at a function supertype whose arguments or result need converting (records,
  variants, options, tuples, functions): it coerces each argument from the target parameter type to the closure's
  and the result back, so `Fun(x: Small): Big` works as `Fun(x: Big): Small`.
- **Function Type Adapters (`quest_adapt_fun_<digest>`) and Invokers (`quest_invoke_fun_<digest>`):** Every
  function type with a runtime descriptor gets an adapter and an invoker, referenced by the descriptor, for
  conversions known only at run time; see [c-representation.md](c-representation.md) §6.4 (Compound Descriptor
  Payloads, Functions).
- **Descriptor Templates (`_emit_template_descriptors`):** A type that mentions type parameters in scope is
  described by a template instantiated at run time with their descriptors; the templates the generated code uses are
  emitted after it, ahead of the function definitions; see [c-representation.md](c-representation.md) §6.4.5.
- **Tuple Structural Coercion & Generic Returns (`_coerce_tuple_val`):** Coercions between tuples whose field C types
  differ (e.g., concrete scalar to `QVal`, closure adaptation, nested tuple structural conversions, or generic tuple
  returns where `QVal` fields are unwrapped into concrete types) allocate a new target tuple and map each field.
  - **Fat Pointer & Variant Support:** Unwrapping `QVal` fields into concrete record fat pointers (`QRecordVal`) or
    variants (`QVariantVal`) invokes `quest_record_unbox` or `quest_variant_unbox`.
  - **Record Subtyping & Tag Remapping:** Coercions attach evidence dictionaries for subtyped records and apply static
    tag remapping arrays for variants across subtyping boundaries.
  - If all field C types match identically, zero-cost pointer casting is retained.
- **End-to-End Golden Verification:** Verified across all phases (`tokenize`, `parse`, `typecheck`, `interpret`,
  `run_c_compiled`) via `existential_packages.quest`, `existential_adt.quest`, `cardelli_syntax.quest`, and
  `polymorphic_refs_records.quest`.

## 11. Host Compiler Runner (`compiler_runner.py`)

The compiler runner manages external C compiler toolchain discovery, Boehm GC flags, and native executable generation:

### 11.1. Compiler Discovery
`find_c_compiler()` searches `PATH` in order:
1. `clang` (preferred on macOS/Linux for optimal diagnostic output and C99 statement expression support).
2. `gcc` (fallback).

### 11.2. Boehm GC Auto-Detection & `--nogc`
`detect_gc_flags(nogc: bool)` locates the Boehm Garbage Collector:
- Standard paths checked: `/opt/homebrew/opt/bdw-gc` (Apple Silicon), `/usr/local/opt/bdw-gc` (Intel macOS), `/usr`.
- If found: passes `-I<prefix>/include -L<prefix>/lib -lgc`.
- If not found or when `--nogc` flag is specified: passes `-DQUEST_NOGC`, using standard libc `calloc`/`malloc`.

### 11.3. Compilation Invocation
`compile_c_source(c_source, output_path, nogc)`:
1. Writes emitted C source to a temporary file (`.c`).
2. Constructs compilation command:
   ```bash
   clang -std=c99 -Wall -Wextra -O2 \
     -I <repo_root>/runtime <repo_root>/runtime/quest_runtime.c \
     <repo_root>/runtime/quest_serialization.c \
     <temp.c> -o <out_bin> [GC_FLAGS]
   ```
3. Executes command via `subprocess.run()`. On failure, captures `stderr` and raises `RuntimeError`.
4. Cleans up temporary C source file.
